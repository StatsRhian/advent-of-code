## Setup

[The original challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1)

## My thoughts

- I realise I didn't have Quarto set up for running Python chunks and I needed to install nbformat

- I don't have a good understanding of the different object types in Python and what is and isn't allowed

- Using ChatGPT to answer stupid Python questions is faster than trawling Stack Overflow. Although I do like that you get a mix of answers and approaches on Stack Overflow, when I'm just trying to get started with basic examples, Chat GPT is good enough.

- And yes, 0 indexing did catch me out ðŸ¤¦

- I know basically nothing about Python, so let's see how far I can make it before I give up and switch back to R...

## Part 1

```{python}
import numpy as np
input = np.loadtxt("input", dtype=int) 
```

```{python}
list0 = np.array(sorted(input[:, 0]))
list1 = np.array(sorted(input[:, 1]))

sum(abs(list0 - list1))
```

## Part 2

```{python}
count=np.zeros(1000)
for i in range(len(list0)):
    count[i] = np.count_nonzero(list1 == list0[i])

sum(count * list0)
```
