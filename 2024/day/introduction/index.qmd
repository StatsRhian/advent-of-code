Most years I don't do Advent of Code. And it's unlikely I'll get more than a few days into it this year. 

Honestly, building R packages, Quarto websites and creating GitHub issues is often more fun for me than solving computer programming puzzles.

However, here I am, thinking about it again. Why?

- I'm a little pycurious, and advent of code is a nice opportunity to dabble in Python
- I'm trying to become less of a perfectionist, and so trying to solve something with limited time and uploading it is a good skill for me to practice.
- A couple of people in the [NHS-R community](https://join.slack.com/t/nhsrcommunity/shared_invite/zt-2r1yjgkio-steh_TwjVUJXdMDhKl~kjA) are doing it - and it's more fun with friends
- I really liked [Ella's cute template for a website](https://github.com/EllaKaye/advent-of-code-website-template).

Will I make it past day 3? Who knows ðŸ¤·
