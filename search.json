And it‚Äôs unlikely I‚Äôll get more than a few days into it this year.\nHonestly, building R packages, Quarto websites and creating GitHub issues is often more fun for me than solving computer programming puzzles.\nHowever, here I am, thinking about it again. Why?\n\nI‚Äôm a little pycurious, and advent of code is a nice opportunity to dabble in Python\nI‚Äôm trying to become less of a perfectionist, and so trying to solve something with limited time and uploading it is a good skill for me to practice.\nA couple of people in the NHS-R community are doing it - and it‚Äôs more fun with friends\nI really liked Ella‚Äôs cute template for a website.\n\nWill I make it past day 3?
